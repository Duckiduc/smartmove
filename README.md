  SMARTMOVE Project
</h1>

SMARTMOVE is an award-winning solution developed at Vivatech's hackathon that aims to show all the alternatives to car ownership in order to decongest cities and reduce carbon emissions.

The SMARTMOVE application and dashboard provide a comprehensive overview of the various mobility options available in a city, including public transportation, car sharing, bike sharing, and more. By using SMARTMOVE, users can easily find and compare the most environmentally-friendly and cost-effective ways to get around their city.

This project is built using Gatsbyjs and TypeScript.
